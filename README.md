# Pash

Pash is a lightweight personal dashboard designed for fullscreen display on a secondary monitor.

It pulls Google Calendar events, Google Tasks, and displays personal notes, live weather, and a clock.

Notes are stored locally. Everything runs inside a simple web frontend and optionally as a standalone Electron app.
